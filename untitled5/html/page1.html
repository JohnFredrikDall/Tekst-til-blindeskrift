        A brand new product that transcribes digital text to Braille text!<br />
        Reading and writing for visually impaired and blind made effortless!
    </h3>
    <p>
        Our new product EyeMedium, is revolutionary because it transcribes digital text to a fingertip-readable Braille platform. Writing to mobile phone will also be possible from this device. The device detects what language text is written in, 
        and the tempo of the readers finger moving across the device. When the finger reaches the bottom right of the text, and lifts his/hers finger up, new text will be transcribed onto 
        the surface. See more technical details below.

        There are almost 9300 blind people living in Norway alone. And supposedly more than 320 000 people in Norway were suffering from a form of visual impairment in 2018 (According to Blindeforbundet.no). We behind 
        EyeMedium believe that it should be the best achievable technology possible innovated for those of us that are so unfortunate to be blind, or suffer from serious visual impairment. It is said that the vision receives 80%
        of our sensations. To read should be a human right for everybody, also the blind, when it exists technology that makes this possible. Not only listening to text-readers. Listening is fine, 
        but we want our device to make it possible for blind people to both read, using fingers, and to write text-messages, by connecting EyeMedium to a mobile phone. It exists available technology for these operations today, called screen reader, 
        and read lists. The screen reader is a computer program used by blind and visually impaired people, for gaining access to information viewed on the computer screen. The reading list, is the product that we will
        further develop; an electronic reading device that is designed for people that know Braille. Through EyeMedium we want to optimize the reading, and writing experience for the user, through the newest of sensor technology.

    <h1>EyeMedium</h1>
    <p>
        Let us present EyeMedium, our new electronic sensor device for reading and typing electronically from and to screen device. The size of another handheld device, and sturdy design, makes it fully transportable, 
        and practical to bring to work or other settings in daily life. It is wirelessly connected to preferable device, it only requires that you have a screen reader installed. Today, Windows 10 comes with an integrated screen reader,
        and both Android and IOS mobile phones are delivered with screen reader functionality. There exists a diverse range of screen readers (software) designed to specific processes, and operating systems, and to find out which one 
        is optimal for your use, we recommend visiting this site: <a href="https://www.medialt.no">Medialt.no</a> (Discovered from <a href="https://www.blindeforbundet.no">Blindeforbundet.no</a>).<br />
        Once you have your screen reader software installed, you can use our wireless Reading list -EyeMedium, and have your text directly transcribed to Braille, and write messages in Braille to your mobile phone device of choice. What makes EyeMedium superiour to other existing solutions of this kind, 
        is the integrated sensor-technology that we have applied. Through this, the text will automatically step forward (update), when user have read, or typed finished his/hers line of text, i.e. reached the final bottom right space on the device surface. Our sensor technology also adapts to the users reading speed, giving new sentences in an appropriate tempo, 
        which he or her can manually adjust, making reading as effortless and smooth process as possible. The same goes for when writing a message on Braille: the word suggestions (appearing through an audio-voice), will appear fast as user writes words, and he or she can easily maneuver/select the next dictionary suggestion through a pressable button just ahead of the Braille-section.
